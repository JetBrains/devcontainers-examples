/*
This command is the first of three (along with updateContentCommand and postCreateCommand) that finalizes container
setup when a dev container is created.
It and subsequent commands execute inside the container immediately after it has started for the first time.
Cloud services can use this command when caching or prebuilding a container.
This means that it will not typically have access to user-scoped assets or secrets.

Note that the array syntax will execute the command without a shell.
