Indicates whether devcontainer.json supporting tools should stop the containers when the related tool window is closed / shut down.
Values are none, stopContainer (default for image or Dockerfile), and stopCompose (default for Docker Compose).

}
/*
The value `none` in the `shutdownAction` parameter of the `devcontainer.json` file is used when you want
the container to continue running after closing the JetBrains IDE window or disconnecting from the container.

This can be useful in several scenarios:
**Long-Running Processes**
If there are long-running tasks in your container, such as machine learning model training, processing large volumes
of data, or other background processes, you might want these processes to continue running uninterrupted
when the IDE is closed.

**Services and Daemons**
If the container is running a service, a development server, or a database that you want to continue using after
the editor is closed, `none` would also be a useful setting.

**Save Time on Re-entries**
Resuming work with an already running container is faster than waiting for it to stop and restart.
