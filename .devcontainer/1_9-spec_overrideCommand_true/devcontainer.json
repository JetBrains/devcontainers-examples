/*
Tells devcontainer.json supporting services / tools whether they should run /bin/sh -c "while sleep 1000; do :; done"
when starting the container instead of the containerâ€™s default command (since the container can shut down
if the default command fails). Set to false if the default command must run for the container to function properly.
Defaults to true for when using an image Dockerfile and false when referencing a Docker Compose file.
