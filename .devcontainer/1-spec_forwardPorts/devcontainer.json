  /*
  An array of port numbers or "host:port" values (e.g. [3000, "db:5432"])
  that should always be forwarded from inside the primary container
  to the local machine (including on the web).
  The property is most useful for forwarding ports
  that cannot be auto-forwarded
  because the related process that starts before the devcontainer.json
  supporting service / tool connects or for forwarding a service
  not in the primary container in Docker Compose scenarios (e.g. "db:5432").
  Defaults to [].
