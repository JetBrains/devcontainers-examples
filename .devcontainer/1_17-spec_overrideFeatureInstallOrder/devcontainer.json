/*
By default, Features will attempt to automatically set the order they are installed based on
a installsAfter property within each of them.
This property allows you to override the Feature install order when needed.
For example:
"overrideFeatureInstallOrder": [ "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils", "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli" ]
