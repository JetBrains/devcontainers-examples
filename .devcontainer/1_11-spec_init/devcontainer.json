/*
Passes the --init flag when creating the dev container.
The `init` option in the `devcontainer.json` configuration file is associated with the use of `tini`.
`tini` serves as a minimal init system, designed for use within containers.
It acts as the parent process for all the commands executed and files run in the container,
managing the lifecycle of processes including their proper termination.
In containerized environments, especially when working with Docker, processes inside the container can become
"zombie processes" (processes that have completed execution but still occupy a slot in the process table).
Zombie processes can arise if a process terminates but its parent process does not invoke the `wait()` function to retrieve the termination status of its child process.
In such scenarios, `tini` functions as a parent that properly handles the termination of child processes, preventing
them from turning into "zombies".
